The Event Management System is a platform that allows users to register, log in, and manage events effectively. Users can create events by providing details such as name, description, and date, and view the events they have created on their personalized dashboard. The system displays event information like name, description, date, and the number of attendees. Built with React.js on the frontend, Node.js with Express on the backend, and MySQL for data storage, the application utilizes JWT for secure user authentication. It offers a simple, organized way to manage and participate in events, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.
